# Animated QR Code Scanner

This tool allows you to scan animated QR codes containing data formatted in the **UR (Uniform Resources)** type. It seamlessly processes QR sequences to reconstruct the encoded message.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK 21**
- **JavaFX**
- **Scene Builder**

## What is the UR Type?

**URs (Uniform Resources)** provide a method for encoding structured binary data for transport in URIs and QR codes. This format is particularly useful for secure and efficient data sharing in constrained environments.
